## Game Controls
* WASD or Arrows to move.
* R to reload from last checkpoint.

## Editor Controls
* Left Click  - Create tile or drag to draw rectangle.
* Right Click - Delete rectangle under cursor, also cancels dragging.
* Shift + Click - Place inverse blocks, i.e. in Sidescroller mode place red walls (not every block is mode-dependent)
* Ctrl  + Click - Place purple walls which block Sidescroller and TopDown guy.
* Number keys - switch tile types (see top-left gui panel.)

* Ctrl-S - Save
* Ctrl-O - Re-load level from disk (surprisingly useful!)

* Space - Change game modes, equivalent to going through a portal.
* G - Hide some editor gui elements like the grid.
* Scroll - Zoom.

Draw walls and checkpoints by dragging. Some tiles can only be placed one at a time.
